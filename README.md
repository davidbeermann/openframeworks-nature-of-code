# The Nature of Code for openFrameworks 0.9.3

This repository contains a very incomplete implementation of [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/)'s book [*The Nature of Code*](http://natureofcode.com/) for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) v0.9.3. I started this repository while working on my master thesis project [*Timely Matter*](https://github.com/davidbeermann/timely-matter) but eventually lacked the time to continue working on it. I uploaded the code anyways for the purpose of documentation of my thesis project and as a reminder for myself to return to this worthwhile endeavour.

In case you came to this page not by searching on GitHub for an implementation of Shiffman's code in openFrameworks, there are [many more people](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=nature+of+code+openframeworks&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults) who managed to implement way more thoroughly than I did up to this point.

All code is written for [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/) v0.9.3. Released under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
